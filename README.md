    Octave: GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations.
      It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linearand nonlinear problems, and for performing
      other numerical experiments.It is used for performing numerical computation for backend.
    Python: It is used for making a connection between backend and frontend.
    Flask :Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.
